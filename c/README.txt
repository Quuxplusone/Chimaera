Chimaera Version C1.001A 12th May 2003
======================================

Create a directory named CHIMAERA and copy the following files

 CHIMAERA.EXE
 CHIMAERA.HTM 

into it.

To run the program, open an MSDOS window, move to the CHIMAERA directory
(typically by typing \CHIMAERA) and type CHIMAERA

Please note that version C1.001A is an alpha-test copy and may contain
bugs which will be fixed in later version.  Also that some of the
commands do not yet work properly (or indeed at all). 

You may SAVE your current game, the saved file will be found in the
directory from whcih you ran the program and may be restarted from where
you left it by running CHIMAERA and RESTORING at any point after the
initial location description has been displayed. 

Note that saved games from version C1.001A may not be restorable into
later versions of CHIMAERA. 

Version C1.001A also creates a text log file (CHIMAERA.LOG), this
records everything which was displayed on the screen during your last
game.  Each time CHIMAERA is run the log file is overwritten, so if you
want to preserve it make a copy with a different file name.  The log
file is a simple text file which may be read in Windows Notepad or any
text editor (or in MS Word). 

Please report any bugs or inconsistencies to me at
chris@rebus.demon.co.uk titling your message 'CHIMAERA Bug Report',
stating the nature of the problem and preferably enclosing a copy of the
relevant log file. 

For more information open CHIMAERA.HTM in Internet Explorer or Netscape. 

Have fun

Chris
