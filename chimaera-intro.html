<h2 class=centered><center>Chimaera Version c1.001</h2>
<hr>
<table class=main cellpadding=10><tr><td>
The Fortran version of the classical Colossal Cave adventure was
developed by Willie Crowther, Don Woods and Gary Palter.  This game,
enjoyed by many of us in the 1970s, had about 80 locations and numerous
puzzles to be solved.  If played optimally it could yield 360 points, at
which stage "<i>a cheering band of friendly elves carry the conquering
adventurer off into the sunset</i>". 

<p>Colossal Cave was great fun but it had one major drawback - it was
finite; you could eventually achieve a perfect score, become an
Adventurer Grandmaster and that was that.  It might take many months to
achieve perfection, but once you had done it what was left?  You could
hang around the office enjoying the struggles of Novice Class
Adventurers, perhaps dropping the occasion hint to help them on their
way or you could get on with real life - such as it is.  I decided that
it would be fun to try to write an adventure program which resembled
real life in its scope and unpredictability.  The result, Chimaera, was
first conceived in 1983 and implemented in Fortran in January 1984. 

<p>A Chimaera is defined by the Concise Oxford Dictionary as:

<blockquote><small>
<i>n</i> <b>1</b>.  (Gk Myth.) Monster with lion's head, goat's body,
and serpent's tail.  <b>2</b>.  Bogy; thing of hybrid character;
fanciful conception; hence chimerical (k-) <i>a</i> <b>3</b>.  (Biol.)
Organism formed by grafting etc.  from tissues of different genetic
origin.  <b>4</b>.  (Zool.) Fish of family Chimaeridae.  [f.  L f.  Gk
<i>khimaira</i> she-goat, chimera]
</small></blockquote>

The Chimaera is intended to be '<i>a thing of hybrid character and
fanciful conception</i>'.  Superficially it resembles Colossal Cave
(indeed there has been a little grafting) but it avoids many of the
earlier program's limitations and there is no easily definable maximum
score.  There are limits to the number of objects and creatures to be
found, but some of these are virtual and do not even exist until certain
conditions have been met.  Furthermore it appears to the user that there
are an indefinite number of locations; the descriptions and properties
of these are determined programmatically.  And to add further complexity
there are 11 Chimaera adventures to choose from (<i>see below</i>). 

<p>For over a decade Chimaera version 1.113 [Fortran] languished in the
archives until a meeting with an old and valued friend early in 2002
stimulated me to revisit the program.  I decided to recode it in ANSI C
and the present program <b>Chimaera version c1.001</b> is the result. 

<p>
<h3>Concept:</h3>
<ul>

  <li>The object of the game is to amass as much treasure and other
   property as possible in the tent at your base camp - which you have to
   find at some stage.  There is no easily calculable maximum score but a
   scores of more than 1,000 should be achievable. 

  <p><li>There are 11 starting points (0-10), Games 1-10 are consistent
   in that when they are replayed all locations and objects should appear
   in the same places and sequence each time the game is played.  The
   various creatures encountered will depend on the actual sequence of
   moves made and may not always appear in the same places or at the same
   times.  The starting point for Game 0 is chosen randomly and the chances
   that any two such games will behave consistently are correspondingly
   remote. 

  <p><li>Each game begins with the message: "<i>You are standing on a
   wide grassy plain; far off the snow clad tops of distant mountains gleam
   in the rays of the rising sun.  Isolated trees are dotted about the
   landscape and groups of animals can dimly be seen moving about some way
   off.</i>" However, your actual starting point on the plain, the nature
   of the local terrain, the location and distance of your base camp, and
   the date and time of day depend on the game number you have selected. 
   You may explore the plain, there are objects to find and various hazards
   to encounter but the real adventure begins when you venture into the
   depths, where the really valuable stuff and the main hazards and puzzles
   are to be found. 

  <p><li>Once you move from the starting place most locations and
   situations are described by computationally generated text, over 20,000
   location descriptions can be computed although not all may be accessible
   to you.  This is because the possibilities for moving between adjacent
   locations are usually limited.  Occasionally you may get into a place
   from which there appears to be no exit, although you will usually be
   warned if this is likely.  If you do get trapped there will usually be a
   means of escape but it may not be obvious and will be expensive. 
   Objects, creatures and puzzles to be solved will be encountered in an
   apparently random (though consistent) manner.  As with Colossal Cave,
   you may eventually be able find short cuts between locations. 

  <p><li>Games may be saved and subsequently restored.  The geography of
   a restored game will always be the same as the original but some objects
   may have been moved by the elves whilst the game was in limbo.  You are
   strongly advised to keep maps tracking your movements, with many
   thousands of possible locations it is easy to get lost completely and if
   you put something down you may never be able to find it again unless you
   have a map. 

   <p>A system of optionally available context-sensitive hints is being
   developed but is unlikely to be fully functional before version c1.1 is
   released. 

   <p><li>In version c1.001 simple commands are used (as in the Colossal
   Cave adventure).  Your input may be in lower, UPPER or MiXeD case and
   most commands may be abbreviated to their first four characters.  The
   program uses a fairly small set of commands; some of these may only
   become available once certain conditions are met and others may
   disappear after they have been used.  A dictionary is not provided and
   the best way to find out if a word of command is recognised is to type
   it in and see what happens.  The primary purpose of Chimaera is to pose
   a set of interesting problems, not to entertain the user with a flashy
   interface.  Fancy input parsing to handle 'natural language' input may
   be introduced in a future version of Chimaera if I can be bothered to
   get round to it.

<p>Players are graded according to their score when they leave
the program.  So far very few players have progressed beyond the
Apprentice grade.</p>
