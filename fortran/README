  NEWLIN throws a new line
  NINDW  work out day of week from "number of days since 1st jan 1970"
  NUFRD  converts date to number of days since 1st Jan 1970
  PASSWD obtains password without echoing it
  SFIL$R space-fills a given number of words (byte pairs) in a buffer
  TOKEN$ extracts a space-delimited token from a text buffer
  TOVFIS displays a floating point number
  UPCASE uppercases a string
  ZFIL$R zero-fills a given number of words (byte pairs) in a buffer
